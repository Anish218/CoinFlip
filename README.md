# CoinFlip
In this code I have made a coin flip game,in which multiple user can be created and bet on coin fliping.
firstly:-
1.CreateUser function will create a user which will bet.
2.Bet function will help user to bet on there respective choice.
3.RewardBet will calculate the result and will assign the respective amount  to the particular user.
4.checkresult function will help user to check its particular result.
I could have made this more dynamic and flexible and more advance if more time would have been given.
